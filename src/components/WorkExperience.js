        This is where it all started, I learned the basics and instantly fell for bartending!
        Artisanâ€™s seen my very first steps behind the bar. At first with stock and ice buckets and in a short while I got an opportunity to step up and learn how to make drinks. After a short but very intensive training program, I started to smash my first drinks. I fell in love with bartending, started buying books and learning on my own. And this passion has stayed with me ever since.

        An amazing opportunity to show my passion to learn and teach at the same time.
        About a year into my new career, I got an offer to enter a bar team of a smaller independent restaurant as a bar supervisor. It was a great first management experience, all from handling the money, opening and closing the venue, ordering stock, solving the problems on shifts and teaching new staff members.
